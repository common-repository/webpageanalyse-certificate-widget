Webpageanalyse is a free analysis tool for websites. We collect domain related data from various sources and condense, analyse and process it. Afterwards we generate a report for every webpage. Beside a complete domain analysis we offer different information like whois, website load time, ip lookip and PageRank as independent tools.

The WebPageAnalyse Certificate Widget can also be generated purely as HTML without using this plugin. Just use the following link: http://www.webpageanalyse.com/widgets
